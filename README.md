# Web-Design-Challenge

The goal was to replicate the website for Latitude vs X data using html.

I opted for bootstrap to layout the elements
The bootstrap navigation bar has optional collapsable menu at smaller screen sizes. It took some effort to get everything in the right place and behave how I wanted it. It has not been tested on our screen sizes and resolutions, they may behave slight differently.

The graph areas are all set up with resonsive columns that keep the visuals neatly organized at different sizes.

A jupyter notebook file is included that shows how data was converted to html. Some small tweaks were made to make it all look nice.

Text around the images is pretty basic, but I believe not the focus of this exercise. We are trying to build a website, not a research project
